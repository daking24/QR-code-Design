### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned the art of centralizing cards using flexbox by justifying the content in the parent element and aligning items in the child element.


```css
main {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

child-element {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I would be working on using CSS variables in future projects and challenges.

### Useful resources
